* **💡 Practical:** Tweezer is designed to support with navigating through compiled code, and supporting predicting function names in stripped binaries.
* **🛠️ Ghidra Integration:** Tweezer utilises Ghidra for decompilation.
* **🤖 Machine Learning:** Utilising Word2Vec to build a picture of decompiled code.

Word2Vec is a widely used technique in natural language processing (NLP) for converting words into dense vectors that capture semantic relationships between words. The underlying idea is rooted in the distributional hypothesis, which poses that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. In the context of Tweezer, Word2Vec is employed to vectorize decompiled code snippets. During the training phase, the model learns to represent words (in this case, decompiled pseudo C) as vectors in a continuous vector space. These vectors preserve the syntactic and semantic information of the corresponding words, enabling the model to understand relationships between different functions based on their co-occurrence patterns. Consequently, when Tweezer encounters a decompiled function, it uses the trained Word2Vec model to convert the code into vectors. By comparing these vectors, Tweezer can identify and retrieve functions with similar code structures, aiding in the task of finding the closest functions in terms of code similarity. 

# ⚙️ Setup
## Dependancies
Tweezer requires [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to be installed, and for ```analyzeHeadless``` to be on your path. If it is not on your path Tweezer will request on run where the binary is located. To install all other dependancies use the ```requirements.txt``` file, with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Running
Depending on if you already have a trained model/ map of vectors you may decide to run Tweezer in one of two ways, either 1) to train a new model/ extend an existing model or 2) to run Tweezer against a decompiled function or binary. 

### Training/ Extending the Model
```bash
python tweezer --model-path <model-path> --binary-locations <binary-folder-1> <binary-folder-2>...
```

### Finding Closest Functions
```bash
python tweezer --model-path <model-path> --function <path-to-decompiled-function>
```

### Building Function Name Map
```bash
python tweezer --model-path <model-path> --binary <path-to-binary>
```
